# RTCPeerConnection


## What is this?

A tiny browser module that gives normalizes and simplifies the API for WebRTC peer connections.

It gives us a cleaner (cross-browser) way to handle offer/answer and is based on an Event Emitter.

If you're not using browserify or you want AMD support use `rtcpeerconnection.bundle.js`.


## Installing

```
npm install rtcpeerconnection
```

## How to use it


### Instantiation

Instantiation takes the same options as a normal peer connection constructor:

```js
var PeerConnection = require('rtcpeerconnection');


// init it like a normal peer connection object
// passing in ice servers/constraints
var pc = new PeerConnection({servers}, {constraints});
```


### Events


Unlike stock Peer Connections this is an event emitter. Powered by [WildEmitter](http://github.com/henrikjoreteg/wildemitter) which has a very familiar API if you're used to node.js/jQUery/Backbone but also includes a wildcard handler so you can easily debug events. Just do `emitter.on('*')` to log them out or whatnot.

But instead of doing `pc.onicecandidate = function () {}` on a peer connection you listen for events like this:


```js

// ice candidates
pc.on('ice', function (candidate) {
    // it's your job to send these to someone
    connection.send('ice', candidate);
});

// you can listen for end of candidates (not particularly useful)
pc.on('endOfCandidates', function () {
    // no more ice candidates
});

// remote stream added
pc.on('streamAdded', function (stream) {
    // do something with the remote stream
    // probably attach it to a <video> element
    // and play it.
});

// remote stream removed
pc.on('streamRemoved', function (stream) {
    // remote stream removed
    // now you could hide/disable removed video
});

// you can chose to listen for events for 
// offers and answers instead, if you prefer 
pc.on('answer', function (answer) { ... });
pc.on('offer', function (offer) { ... });

// on peer connection close
pc.on('close', function () { ... });
```


### Methods

Note that all callbacks follow the "error first" convention. Meaning, rather than pass a success and fail callback, you pass a single callback.

If there is an error, the first argument passed to the callback will be a truthy value (the error itself).

The whole offer/answer cycle looks like this:

```js
// assumptions
var pc = new PeerConnection(servers, constraints);
var connection = new RealTimeConnection(); // could be socket.io or whatever


// create an offer
pc.offer(function (offer) {
    connection.send('offer', offer)
});

// you can also optionally pass in constraints
// when creating an offer.
pc.offer({
        mandatory: {
            OfferToReceiveAudio: true,
            OfferToReceiveVideo: false
        }
    }, 
    function (err, offer) {
        if (!err) connection.send('offer, offer);
    }
);

// when you get an offer, you can answer
// with various options
connection.on('offer', function (offer) {
    // you can just call answer
    pc.answer(offer, function (err, answer) {
        if (!err) connection.send('answer', answer);
    });

    // you can call answer with contstraints
    pc.answer(offer, MY_CONSTRAINTS, function (err, answer) {
        if (!err) connection.send('answer', answer);
    });    

    // or you can use one of the shortcuts answers

    // for video only
    pc.answerVideoOnly(offer, function (err, answer) { ... });

    // and audio only
    pc.answerAudioOnly(offer, function (err, answer) { ... });
});

// when you get an answer, you just call
// handleAnswer
connection.on('answer', function (answer) {
    pc.handleAnswer(answer);
});

// the only other thing you have to do is listen, transmit, and process ice candidates

// you have to send them when generated
pc.on('ice', function (candidate) {
    connection.send('ice', candidate);
});

// process incoming ones
connection.on('ice', function (candidate) {
    pc.processIce(candidate);
});
```


That's it!
